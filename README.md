First you can enter the width and height of up to 3 windows or doors in your room, this data is then used to work out the total area of the room taken up by any windows or doors which can be subtracted from the total area of the room to work out the amount of paint needed to paint the room.

You can add the width length and height of the room in metres, this is used to work out the area of the floor, the volume of the room and the amount of paint needed to paint the walls.

Just enter any information into the correct text box and then click submit when you have entered the appropriate data. You may leave the box blank when entering windows or doors as you may not neccessarily have 3 windows or doors to add for your room.
